# MagicStream ðŸŽ¥âœ¨

A modern movie streaming platform with AI-powered recommendations, built using cutting-edge web technologies.

---

## Overview  

**MagicStream** is a full-stack web application that simulates a modern movie streaming platform. It combines a **React-based frontend** for a smooth, interactive user interface, a **Go backend using gin-gonic** for high-performance API services, and an **AI recommendation engine** powered by **LangChainGo** and **OpenAI** to provide personalized movie suggestions.  

The platform also leverages **MongoDB** as a scalable database to manage movies, metadata, and user preferences efficiently.

This project demonstrates how modern web technologies can work together to create a high-performance, intelligent, and user-friendly streaming experience.
